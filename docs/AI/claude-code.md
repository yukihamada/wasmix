# Working with Claude Code

Open the repo in VS Code and start Claude Code in the integrated terminal. Ask it to:
- create `src/modules/encode.ts` and `src/modules/journal.ts` per `docs/SPRINT-1.md`,
- write unit-free smoke tests (typecheck/build),
- and produce a PR following `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

**Tip:** Keep diffs small (under 300 lines) and commit after each green run.
